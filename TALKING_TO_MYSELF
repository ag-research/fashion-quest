Fashion Quest

-replace game's go command with pirate_adventure's go command
-have game and pirate_adventure share go command

-score needs work and doesn't end game

Parrot:
-make sure pirate doesn't rush off to go to sleep when back at the first beach

-instead of neverneverland buggering out in a set amount of turns, make it random (1 in 4 chance?)

NAMING:
-id, name, description
-props: singular (pronoun: it), plural (pronoun: they), proper (no pronoun) / gender (default none)
-character: singluar (he/she/it), plural (the <noun>s), proper (no pronoun) / gender (default none)
-doors too?

-maybe noun type defaults to singular 

-should include init logic in config yaml (for includes, etc.)

-naming scheme for props: id for inventory, name for listing in locations (describe method), description for looking

-how exactly does pirate rum->sleep cycle work in Inform version? maybe when pirate is woken up move bottles object back to shore or something
-moving pirate to shore ...
  -if pirate is on ship and character is on shore move pirate to shore
  -what about when pirate is on ship and character is on beach? then move pirate to attic and have him be asleep?
-maybe need to make sense out of naming conundrum first as well

-make look command show a nicer list like inventory command

-on_exchange event... what if different events for different types of exchanges?

-need to clarify how naming works (noun, etc.)
-for descriptions: id, short, long?
-<any> works, but maybe something other than any ... anything? component? object? thing? noun?
-should get prop and door traits by default if not set by yaml to lessen errors in
 commands (we do this for characters)... test this by looping through everything and trying to access traits

NEXT:
-make old game make some sense... it is primarily to show character behaviour
-maybe have "talk <character>" command to get some hints as to what can be talked about

NEXT:
- make a transition so when you first go to the shore, the pirate follows
- then make it so when you give him the bottles, he goes to sleep wherever he goes to sleep
- when you wake the pirate he'll go back to the ship I guess then you can sail again

NEXT:
- make prop attack_strength property into traits

NEXT:
- check new_pirate_notes.txt

NEXT:
- can get parrot, can't get parrot in shack unless pirate isn't there... maybe can use on_get logic?

NEXT: add "prop_anywhere" argument support for commands that work on props that don't have
a location yet (i.e. building or conjuring)

NEXT: migrate properties to traits

-when does the parrot return to the shack? when does parrot fly off? maybe when you got no crackers?

-when you get water
  -changes bottle's description
  -lets you know the water is in the bottle
  -changes water location to 'limbo'
Bottle of salt water

-make sure to copy pirate version of get and go commands to main commands

Exits:
-have option to add exit that isn't visible by default (or just have it so dynamic 
 exits aren't shown, make it dependent to add a description)
or...
-should there be a visible property for exits (for hidden exits?)
-should there be a description property for exits (for fancier language?)

-what do plans say when read?

-clean up event handler situation

-make it so "You see XXX" doesn't show each item on a new line... gets wacky
-work out what things are too big to go through crack and set their sizes
-bottle/water thing is inelegant... water should get contained in bottle

-in lagoon all exits but north go back to beach
-you need safety sneakers or you slip off the window after a few turns

CAVE ROOM 1 (*S2 *E3 *W foot_of_hill *D pit)
CAVE ROOM 2 (*N1 *E foot_of_hill W3)
CAVE ROOM 3 (*N1 *S foot_of_hill *E2 *W4)
CAVE ROOM 4 (*S foot_of_hill *E foot_of_hill *W3)

Bugs:

  -make sure character events in original game work... prolly don't cuz they're set up to have it pick a random
   one

Refactoring?

  -can character room exit getting be refactored? (maybe exits function for room class?)
  -what is player name for?

  -look at commands... make sure the code looks civilized

Feature enhancements:

  Putting:
  -how to implement 'put'... only for props, not characters... uses mechanism like exchange
    -put together gun and silencer
    -put cake in oven
    -look in oven
    -get cake from oven

  Naming:
  -characters and props should have gender for pronoun support
  -characters and props should have plural=true as well
  -characters and props should have proper=true as well (look at search command to see why)
  -in characters, make sure replacing of "name" with "id" doesn't cause problems

Finishing:

  -refine existing code/data structures
  -test on all platforms
  -versions
    -v0.5a will be first version
      -resolve remaining issues
      -rough out roadmap
    -0.6
      -begin unit tests
      -firm up whether class methods are public or private
      -rough out documentation
    -0.7
      -complete documentation
    -0.8
      -
    -0.9
      -
    -1
      -
  -review IF engine framework comparisons: put anything I don't want to do right now on roadmap
  -roadmap will outline goals for each point release
  -have semi-enjoyable sample adventure

Maybe:

  -change the necklace to shoes, have it so the shoes can be given to another character
  -add GPL
  -move appropriate synonyms to command_abbreviations
  -locations and player should be singletons
  -change 'prop_404' to 'not_found_message'
  -if character is dead and has stuff on him, hint at that during look
  -add alert if garbage word appears in command keywords and filter out

Roadmap:

  -proof coding style
  -add unit tests to classes
  -document (rdoc and human doc)
  -create demo game

Remember:

  -using is equivelant to others... i.e. use knife to open door = open door with knife

low priority - make sure the map only falls out when you look at the opened chest

Documentation:
-document how prop setting work (opened, etc.)
