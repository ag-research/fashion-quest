Fashion Quest

-make sure to copy pirate version of get and go commands to main commands

-have option to add exit that isn't visible by default (or just have it so dynamic 
 exits aren't shown, make it dependent to add a description)

-what do plans say when read?

-should there be a visible property for exits (for hidden exits?)
-should there be a description property for exits (for fancier language?)

-clean up event handler situation

-build ship: "I can't! I've no plans!"
  -need build command leveraging build_with and on_build
-in lagoon all exits but north go back to beach
-you need safety sneakers or you slip off the window after a few turns

CAVE ROOM 1 (*S2 *E3 *W foot_of_hill *D pit)
CAVE ROOM 2 (*N1 *E foot_of_hill W3)
CAVE ROOM 3 (*N1 *S foot_of_hill *E2 *W4)
CAVE ROOM 4 (*S foot_of_hill *E foot_of_hill *W3)

Bugs:

  -make sure character events in original game work... prolly don't cuz they're set up to have it pick a random
   one

Refactoring?

  -can character room exit getting be refactored? (maybe exits function for room class?)
  -what is player name for?

  -look at commands... make sure the code looks civilized

Feature enhancements:

  Putting:
  -how to implement 'put'... only for props, not characters... uses mechanism like exchange
    -put together gun and silencer
    -put cake in oven
    -look in oven
    -get cake from oven

  Naming:
  -characters and props should have gender for pronoun support
  -characters and props should have plural=true as well
  -characters and props should have proper=true as well (look at search command to see why)
  -in characters, make sure replacing of "name" with "id" doesn't cause problems

Finishing:

  -refine existing code/data structures
  -test on all platforms
  -versions
    -v0.5a will be first version
      -resolve remaining issues
      -rough out roadmap
    -0.6
      -begin unit tests
      -firm up whether class methods are public or private
      -rough out documentation
    -0.7
      -complete documentation
    -0.8
      -
    -0.9

    -1
      -
  -review IF engine framework comparisons: put anything I don't want to do right now on roadmap
  -roadmap will outline goals for each point release
  -have semi-enjoyable sample adventure

Maybe:

  -change the necklace to shoes, have it so the shoes can be given to another character
  -add GPL
  -move appropriate synonyms to command_abbreviations
  -locations and player should be singletons
  -change 'prop_404' to 'not_found_message'
  -if character is dead and has stuff on him, hint at that during look
  -add alert if garbage word appears in command keywords and filter out

Roadmap:

  -proof coding style
  -add unit tests to classes
  -document (rdoc and human doc)
  -create demo game

Remember:

  -using is equivelant to others... i.e. use knife to open door = open door with knife
