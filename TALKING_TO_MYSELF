These are my notes... you can ingore.

Possible Future Improvements:
-what is player name for? maybe if set make things third-person
-For attacking, add agility to character, the higher it is the harder it is to hit the character
 (no agility or agility 1 will always hit, 2 = 50% of the time, 3 = 33.3% of the time, etc.)
 actually, what can be done is subtract the agility of the attacker from the agility of the attackee
-Characters could have "patrols" (paths they walk back and forth along)
-A "put" command exists so "put in" might be easy to add for refillable containers 
  -put together gun and silencer
  -put cake in oven
  -look in oven
  -get cake from oven
-Add supoprt for pics for props, characters, doors
-Make a way to create a ruby script for issuing commands, for testing the Daydream game
  ...maybe the command will be "run script" or "load script"
-Maybe have a way of opening a directory to run an adventure in it with a "Browse..." button on the selector
-if character is dead and has stuff on him, hint at that during look
-save everything to YAML and binhex graphics? use that like ZCODE

Pirate adventure authenticity concerns:
-Instead of neverneverland ending in a set amount of turns, make it random (1 in 4 chance?)
-In lagoon all exits but north go back to beach
-What do plans say when read?
-"pirate takes rum", "pirate grabs rum and scuttles..." is redundant
-Get rug attempt without hammer should say "Sorry I can't. It's nailed to the floor!"
-Maybe have on_get overrule normal output of prop opening so opening book can make "Something falls out." 

Cool puzzle to try sometime:
-room contains fire hydrant and open window too high to reach
-need wrench to open
-if you open it it floods the room and rushes out the door
-if you have door closed room will fill to the open window
-if you are wearing lifejacket you will float and can go through the open window
