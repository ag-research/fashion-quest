I know it is wrong to make frameworks, but it happens.

Fashion Quest is an interactive fiction framework being created so we can make
a text adventure game about fashion because we do not have the resources to
make a movie.

It uses Shoes for cross-platform interface and is thus written in the Ruby.

The framework is in progress. To test the framework I am converting the 1978
game Pirate Adventure to the framework. This is also in progress.

The game is largely defined using YAML files.

Some super rough documentation is present as DOC_OUTLINE.

Some scrawls about intentions and feelings are present as TALKING_TO_MYSELF.

You can check out what's done so far in the Pirate Adventure conversion
by going:

  shoes fq.rb pirate_adventure

But it's still getting made so you prolly should wait if you want to play
the whole game of old.
