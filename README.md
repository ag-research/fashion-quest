Fashion Quest is an interactive fiction framework being created so we can make
a text adventure game about fashion because we love fashion and we love text
adventure games.

Games created with the framework define the game using YAML files and bits of
Ruby.

You need Shoes to use this so download Shoes now to your computer:

 http://shoesrb.com/downloads.html

Run shoes then open `run.rb` to try one of the sample games.

Sample games
------------

Four test games come with the source and are location in the "games" directory.

The game *"Fashion Quest: Daydream"* is very small and mainly for demo purposes.
It lives in the "games/daydream" directory.

The game *"Pirate Adventure Knockoff"* is a port of the 1978 text adventure 
"Pirate Adventure" by Scott Adams and lives in the "games/pirate_adventure"
directory.

The game *"Cloak of Darkness"* is a port of a game that is used to compare IF
frameworks. It shows how a game can be defined using one file (as is possible
with games written using Inform and other frameworks). It lives in the
"games/cloak_of_darkness" directory.

There is game stump in the "games/new_game" directory that can be used as a blank
slate when starting development of a new game. 

Documentation
-------------

Documentation can be found online at <http://mcantelon.github.io/fashion-quest/doc/build/html/index.html>.

Known issues
------------

There are a couple platform-specific issues:

* Linux:

  Scrolling is jerky when a game incorporates images.

* Windows:

  When output window contains a lot of text, the game slows down.

  Workaround: Use "clear" command to clear the output window.
