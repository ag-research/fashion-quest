Fashion Quest
===

Fashion Quest is an interactive fiction framework being created so we can make
a text adventure game about fashion because we love fashion and we love text
advenutre games.

You need Shoes to use this so download Shoes now to your computer:

Games created with the framework define the game using YAML files and bits of
Ruby.

The framework is creeping towards alpha. Two test games come with the source. 
The game "Fashion Quest: Daydream" is very small and mainly for demo purposes.
It lives in the "game" directory. The game "Pirate Adventure Knockoff" is a
port of the 1978 text adventure "Pirate Adventure" by Scott Adams and lives in
the "pirate_adventure" directory.

To play either of these use Shoes to run fq.rb and select which you'd like
to play.

Some super rough documentation is present as DOC_OUTLINE.

Thanks to Why the Lucky Stiff for creating Shoes and inspiring the creative
