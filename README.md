Fashion Quest
===

Fashion Quest is an interactive fiction framework being created so we can make
a text adventure game about fashion because we do not have the resources to
make a movie.

It uses Shoes for cross-platform interface and is thus written in the Ruby.
Games created with the framework define the game using YAML files and bits
of Ruby.

The framework is in progress. To test the framework I am converting the 1978
game Pirate Adventure to the framework. This is not yet complete!

You can see where things are at by typing:

  shoes fq.rb pirate_adventure

Some super rough documentation is present as DOC_OUTLINE.

TALKING_TO_MYSELF is my private time.
