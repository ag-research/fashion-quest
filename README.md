Fashion Quest
===

Fashion Quest is an interactive fiction framework being created so we can make
a text adventure game about fashion because we do not have the resources to
make a movie.

It uses Shoes for cross-platform interface and is thus written in the Ruby.
Games created with the framework define the game using YAML files and bits
of Ruby.

The framework is in progress. Two test games come with the source. The game
"Fashion Quest: Daydream" is very small and mainly for demo purposes. It lives
in the "game" directory. The game "Pirate Adventure Knockoff" is a port of the
1978 text adventure "Pirate Adventure" by Scott Adams and lives in the
"pirate_adventure" directory.

To play either of these use Shoes to run fq.rb and select which you'd like
to play.

Some super rough documentation is present as DOC_OUTLINE.

TALKING_TO_MYSELF is crude notes to myself.
